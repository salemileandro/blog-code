## 1. Installation

I usually manage simple python environment with [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/). If you're
using rye, you can install the local python environment using

```bash
rye sync
```

If you're not using rye, you can just rely on the `pyproject.toml`, e.g., create a 
virtual environment and then install the dependencies via pip.
